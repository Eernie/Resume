Inversive Media bought address data from 'Basisregistraties Adressen en Gebouwen'.
This was a dataset of 16GB and they wanted it transformed in to a service.
I created an import script that imported the 16GB of data in to a ElasticSearch server.
After this I wrote a REST service to query the addresses in multiple ways.
